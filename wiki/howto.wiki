== How does THT link windows? ==

THT emulates a keyboard input. Please don't assign latin letters to be hotkeys in Graybox and other software you want to link to. If you assign some letter in Graybox (or other software you want to link to), say "B", to open a new position, and try to link "BWA" ticker, Graybox will open a new position, and will try to load "WA" ticker.

== How to link several windows? ==

Notes:

 * <font color=red>The main Advanced Get window must also be visible (not minimized), otherwise links will be established but won't work correctly.</font>

 * <font color=red>If you run the application you want to link to (Advanced Get, or Graybox, or whatever) as administrator, you need to run as administrator THT too.</font>

== What about the input language? ==

The current input language must be English when loading tickers to the linked windows.

== How to reset links? ==

== How to use ticker lists? ==

Click on a ticker with a left mouse button, or use "up" and "down" arrows on your keyboard to navigate through the list. When the ticker is selected, THT will load it to all linked windows.

== How to export tickers? ==

Click on "Export tickers" button. You can export to a file or clipboard.

== How to use priorities? ==

Increase or decrease priorities for tickers with hotkeys. This will help you to remember tickers with interesting support or resistance levels, new highs etc.

== How to load predefined tickers? ==

Activate a window shortcut or select a ticker from the context menu.

== How to show NYSE-only trades? ==

Turn on a "=N" option. This option will append "=N" to all tickers when loading to Advanced Get (Graybox MM doesn't support this).

== What do all these THT settings mean? ==

*Number of lists* - the number of ticker lists you prefer.

*Always on top* - THT window will always be on top of other windows (like Graybox).

*Hide to tray* - hide to tray when user closes the THT window.

*Save position and size* - THT will save window position and its size.

*Automatically save tickers* - when you add, delete or move tickers THT will save the ticker lists automatically. Otherwise you need to save them manually. When the ticker list is not saved, you will see a red line on top of it. Click "Save tickers" to save the list in this case.

== How to check for updates? ==

Open "About" dialog. If updates are available, you will see an exclamation icon on the right as it shown on a picture. If you are in a corporate network with a firewall, this may not work correctly. In this case you need to visit this website by yourself.

== Graybox warning ==

_It is nothing to do with THT, just a note._ Graybox is unable to save settings to the remote database if you have decimal point other than "." (dot) in your regional settings. Open your regional settings to be sure it is configured correctly.
