Notes:

 * <font color=red>The main Advanced Get window must also be visible (not minimized), otherwise links will be established but won't work correctly.</font>

 * <font color=red>If you run the application you want to link to (Advanced Get, or Graybox, or whatever) as administrator, you need to run as administrator THT too.</font>

== How to show NYSE-only trades? ==

== What do all these THT settings mean? ==

*Number of lists* - the number of ticker lists you prefer.

*Always on top* - THT window will always be on top of other windows (like Graybox).

*Hide to tray* - hide to tray when user closes the THT window.

*Save position and size* - THT will save window position and its size.

*Automatically save tickers* - when you add, delete or move tickers THT will save the ticker lists automatically. Otherwise you need to save them manually. When the ticker list is not saved, you will see a red line on top of it. Click "Save tickers" to save the list in this case.
