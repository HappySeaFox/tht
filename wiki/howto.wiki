== What do all these THT settings mean? ==

*Number of lists* - the number of ticker lists you prefer.

*Always on top* - THT window will always be on top of other windows (like Graybox).

*Hide to tray* - hide to tray when user closes the THT window.

*Save position and size* - THT will save window position and its size.

*Automatically save tickers* - when you add, delete or move tickers THT will save the ticker lists automatically. Otherwise you need to save them manually. When the ticker list is not saved, you will see a red line on top of it. Click "Save tickers" to save the list in this case.

== How to translate THT into my native language? ==

Download and install Qt Linguist from https://code.google.com/p/qtlinguistdownload/downloads/list . Then ask me to generate a new translation file. I'll generate and send it to you. Translate it with Qt Linguist and send me back.

== How to check for updates? ==

Open "About" dialog. If updates are available, you will see an exclamation icon on the right as it shown on a picture. If you are in a corporate network with a firewall, this may not work correctly. In this case you need to visit this website by yourself.

== Graybox warning ==

_It is nothing to do with THT, just a note._ Graybox is unable to save settings to the remote database if you have decimal point other than "." (dot) in your regional settings. Open your regional settings to be sure it is configured correctly.
