== How does THT link windows? ==

THT emulates a keyboard input. Please don't assign latin letters to be hotkeys in Graybox and other software you want to link to. If you assign some letter in Graybox (or other software you want to link to), say "B", to open a new position, and try to link "BWA" ticker, Graybox will open a new position, and will try to load "WA" ticker.

== How to link several Advanced Get windows together? ==

Drag a black target with a left mouse button and drop onto a required AG window. If everything is ok, you will hear a confirmation sound. For example, you can link together 5min, daily and weekly charts.

== What do all these THT settings mean? ==

*Number of lists* - the number of ticker lists you prefer.

*Always on top* - THT window will always be on top of other windows (like Graybox).

*Hide to tray* - hide to tray when user closes the THT window.

*Save position and size* - THT will save window position and its size.

*Automatically save tickers* - when you add, delete or move tickers THT will save the ticker lists automatically. Otherwise you need to save them manually. When the ticker list is not saved, you will see a red line on top of it. Click "Save tickers" to save the list in this case.

== Graybox warning ==

_It is nothing to do with THT, just a note._ Graybox is unable to save settings to the remote database if you have decimal point other than "." (dot) in your regional settings. Open your regional settings to be sure it is configured correctly.
