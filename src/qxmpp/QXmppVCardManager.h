/// \brief The QXmppVCardManager class gets/sets XMPP vCards. It is an
/// implementation of XEP-0054: vcard-temp.
///
/// \note It's object should not be created using it's constructor. Instead
/// QXmppClient::vCardManager() should be used to get the reference of instantiated
/// object this class.
///
/// <B>Getting vCards of entries in Roster:</B><BR>
/// It doesn't store vCards of the JIDs in the roster of connected user. Instead
/// client has to request for a particular vCard using requestVCard(). And connect to
/// the signal vCardReceived() to get the requested vCard.
///
/// <B>Getting vCard of the connected client:</B><BR>
/// For getting the vCard of the connected user itself. Client can call requestClientVCard()
/// and on the signal clientVCardReceived() it can get its vCard using clientVCard().
///
/// <B>Setting vCard of the client:</B><BR>
/// Using setClientVCard() client can set its vCard.
///
/// \note Client can't set/change vCards of roster entries.
